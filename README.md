# Ultrasound-Medical-Image-Denoising
In this paper, the UNet segmentation network is used to extract image features, and CBDNet is used to denoise images. Based on the feature map, we make improvements on the CBDNet output by removing some noise in the original images. Also, The Laplacian pyramid is used to blend the obtained images.
